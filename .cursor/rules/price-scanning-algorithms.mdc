# price-scanning-algorithms

## Core Scanning Logic (Importance: 85/100)
Located in `backend/app/services/price_scanner.py`

### Product Scan Scheduling
- Implements dynamic scan frequency per product
- Executes automated price monitoring workflows
- Manages concurrent price scanning operations
- Tracks price and stock status changes

### History Management
- Records price changes over time
- Maintains stock availability status
- Links pricing data with product availability

## Scheduler Implementation (Importance: 60/100)
Located in `backend/app/scheduler.py`

### Scheduling Features
- Configurable scan intervals per product
- Intelligent scheduling based on product parameters
- Concurrent scan operation management

### Business Rules
1. Products can have individual scan frequencies
2. Price history must track both price and stock status
3. Scheduling system handles concurrent vendor scans
4. Changes in price or stock trigger history updates
