# Developer Preferences

This file specifies the developer's preferred tools, frameworks, and workflows for this project.

## Python Development

### Dependency Management
- **Use pipenv** (NOT venv, poetry, or conda)
- Commands should use `pipenv run` or `pipenv shell`
- Always include `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`
- Python version: 3.11+

### Code Style
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Clear, descriptive variable names

## JavaScript/Node Development

### Package Management
- **Use npm** (default)
- Include `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

### Frontend Framework
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling

## Database

### Primary Database
- **SQLite** for development and production (small scale)
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM
- Include migration scripts in `backend/migrations/`

### Schema Changes
- Always provide migration scripts
- Never assume database schema changes will happen automatically
- Document migration steps in commit messages

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- **Main branch**: `main` (NOT `master`)
- **Feature branches**: `feature/description` (e.g., `feature/ebay-auction-tracking`)
- **Chore branches**: `chore/description` (e.g., `chore/migrate-to-pipenv`)
- **Fix branches**: `fix/description`

### Commits
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include "what" and "why" in commit descriptions
- Group related changes together

## Platform

### Operating System
- **Windows** (primary development environment)
- Use Windows-style paths in documentation (backslashes)
- Provide `.bat` batch scripts for common operations
- Place user-facing scripts in `user_tools/` folder

### Terminal
- PowerShell is the default shell
- Batch files for automation

## Code Organization

### File Structure
- Keep user-facing tools in `user_tools/`
- Keep documentation in root (README, QUICK_START) and `documentation/` folder
- Centralize configuration in root `config.py`

### Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for Python files/functions
- Use kebab-case for folder names
- Use PascalCase for React components

## Time and Date Display

### Formatting
- **12-hour format with AM/PM** (NOT 24-hour)
- Include seconds only when necessary
- Example: "Dec 10, 2025, 11:49 AM"

### Timezone
- Store timestamps in UTC in database
- Convert to local time for display
- Use `'Z'` suffix when parsing UTC timestamps in JavaScript

## Documentation

### Style
- Clear, step-by-step instructions
- Include both "Easy Way" (batch scripts) and "Manual Way"
- Provide examples in code blocks
- Use emoji sparingly for visual organization (✅, 🚀, ⚠️)

### README Requirements
- Quick start section at the top
- Installation instructions
- Configuration guide
- Common troubleshooting

## Testing and Development

### Before Committing
- Test locally on Windows
- Check that batch scripts work
- Verify documentation matches actual commands
- Run linter if available

### Database Migrations
- Always test migrations before committing
- Provide rollback instructions if applicable
- Document what each migration does

## API Development

### REST API Design
- Use FastAPI for backend
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Include proper status codes
- Document endpoints clearly

### Error Handling
- Return meaningful error messages
- Log errors with context
- Don't expose sensitive information in errors

## Performance Considerations

### Cost Awareness
- Be mindful of API costs (e.g., Bright Data scraping)
- Implement free-first fallback strategies
- Provide cost calculators or estimates in documentation

### Optimization
- Prefer efficient solutions over complex ones
- Document performance trade-offs
- Cache where appropriate

## Communication Style

### When Implementing Features
- Provide clear explanations of changes
- Show before/after examples
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous

### When Things Go Wrong
- Offer to help troubleshoot
- Provide clear error messages
- Suggest alternative approaches

## Project-Specific Preferences

### Configuration Management
- Centralize in root `config.py`
- Use single `.env` file at root (not separate backend/frontend)
- Clearly separate frontend and backend configs
- Sensitive data (API keys) in `.env`, not in code

### Automation Scripts
- Provide batch files for common tasks
- Name them clearly (`start-all.bat`, `kill-all.bat`, `clean-data.bat`)
- Make them auto-close when appropriate
- Include in `user_tools/` directory
